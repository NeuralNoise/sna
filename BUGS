- entering "/" removes Auth Session => AFTER rendered

- user creation + auto profile creation (Profile.nickname should EQUAL Profile.id, at first)

- BREADCRUME component buggy (+ afterShutdown of whole cake app)

- pressing one form button adds "spinning wheel", to all forms => should only color all of them grey

- logging out (timeout, or logout and then in another tab pressing a button), then doing a POST/PUT request (security component) -> csrf attack (but its none). Solution, no redirect for post/put, just get. Possibility of adding GET views for non view-post-actions (like Move to Trash)

- / should load UsersController->register_or_login - First via redirect later via Router
