- entering "/" removes Auth Session => bad
- user creation + auto profile creation (Profile.nickname should EQUAL Profile.id, at first)
- BREADCRUME component buggy (+ afterShutdown of whole cake app)
- pressing one form button adds "spinning wheel", to all forms => should only color all of them grey
- /pages/home: requestAction breaks SecurityComponent, element breads associated Gender Model
- logging out (timeout, pressing a tab in one button), then doing a POST/PUT request (security component) -> csrf attack (but its none)
