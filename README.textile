*Thumbnail component for CakePHP* creates big, small and "homepage" copies
of an image, and stores them in folders
	@/app/webroot/img/$folderName/{big|small|home}@

I've started it from the public copy at
"@http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/@":http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/
to have a standard way of uploading files to CakePHP projects.


h2. Usage

# Copy @thumbnail.php@ to @/app/controllers/components/@
# Add component to your controller: @var $components = array('Thumbnail');@
# In your controller action:
	@$img_path = $this->Thumbnail->thumbnail($this->data, 'name', 573, 380, 80, 80, $folderName);@
# In your upload form:
## @echo $form->create('Model',array('type' => 'file'));@
## @echo $form->file('Thumbnail/name');@
# In your view (@$data['Model']['image_path']@ is the stored file name):
	@<?= $html->image($folderName.'/big/'.$data['Model']['image_path']); ?>@

h2. Parameters:

h3. thumbnail($data, $maxw, $maxh, $thumbscalew, $thumbscaleh, $folderName)

* @data@: the image data array from the form
* @maxw/maxh@: maximum width/height for resizing images
* @thumbscalew/thumbscaleh@: maximum width/height scale for resizing images
* @folderName@: the name of the parent folder of the images
