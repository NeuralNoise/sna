*Thumbnail component for CakePHP* creates big, small and "homepage" copies
of an image, and stores them in the folder
	@/app/webroot/img/$folderName/{big|small|home}@

I've started it from the public copy at
"@http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/@":http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/
to have a standard way of uploading files to CakePHP projects.


h2. Installation and usage

Add the component to your controller:
	@var $components = array('Thumbnail');@

In your controller action:
	@$image_path = $this->Thumbnail->thumbnail($this->data, 'name1', 573, 380, 80, 80, 'sets');@

In your view (where @$entries['Entry']['image_path']@ is the stored file name):
	@<?= $html->image($folderName.'/big/'.$entries['Entry']['image_path']); ?>@

h2. Parameters:

* @$data@: the image data array from the form
* @$maxw/$maxh@: maximum width/height for resizing thumbnails
* @$thumbscaleh@: maximum height that you want your thumbnail to be resized to
* @$folderName@: the name of the parent folder of the images
